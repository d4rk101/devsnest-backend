## What are diffrent encryption types
The two main kinds of encryption are symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption. Asymmetric encryption is also known as public key encryption.

In symmetric encryption, there is only one key, and all communicating parties use the same (secret) key for both encryption and decryption. In asymmetric, or public key, encryption, there are two keys: one key is used for encryption, and a different key is used for decryption. The decryption key is kept private (hence the "private key" name), while the encryption key is shared publicly, for anyone to use (hence the "public key" name). Asymmetric encryption is a foundational technology for TLS (often called SSL).


Commonly used symmetric encryption algorithms include:

* AES
* 3-DES
* SNOW
* Commonly used asymmetric encryption algorithms include:

RSA
* Elliptic curve cryptography
